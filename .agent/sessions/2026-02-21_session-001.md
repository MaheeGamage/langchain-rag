## Goal
Fix Poetry dependency installation issues and resolve a module import error so that `python -m app.ingest` runs successfully.

## Prompts Summary
- User asked how Poetry works, given they already had a `.venv` created.
- User asked about Poetry's default venv behaviour.
- User reported `poetry install` failing due to Python version range incompatibility with `langchain-ollama`.
- User reported `poetry install` failing because project had no package source folder.
- User reported `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain.text_splitter'` when running `app.ingest`.
- User reported version conflict between `langchain-text-splitters` constraint and what `langchain-community` requires.

## Actions Taken
- `pyproject.toml`: Changed `requires-python = ">=3.12"` to `requires-python = ">=3.12,<4.0.0"` to satisfy `langchain-ollama`'s Python upper bound.
- `pyproject.toml`: Added `[tool.poetry] package-mode = false` to disable packaging mode and prevent the "No file/folder found for package" error.
- `app/ingest.py`: Changed `from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to `from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (correct module path in LangChain 1.x+).
- `pyproject.toml`: Added `langchain-text-splitters (>=1.0.0,<2.0.0)` as an explicit dependency (initial range `>=0.3.0,<1.0.0` was wrong and conflicted with `langchain-community`; corrected to `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`).

## Outcome
`poetry install` succeeded and `poetry run python -m app.ingest` exited with code 0.
