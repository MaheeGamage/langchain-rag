# Session 001 — Add LangSmith Tracing

**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.6)

## Goal
Integrate LangSmith tracing into the project using the API key and project provided by the user, without changing any models.

## Prompts Summary
User shared a LangSmith setup guide screenshot with a pre-generated API key and project name, and asked to add LangSmith tracing to the project.

## Actions Taken

- **Created** `.env` — LangSmith env vars (`LANGSMITH_TRACING`, `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`, `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, `LANGSMITH_PROJECT`)
- **Created** `.gitignore` — excludes `.env`, `.venv/`, `chroma_db/`, `data/`, `ingest.log`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- **Ran** `poetry add langsmith python-dotenv` — added `python-dotenv` to `.venv` and `pyproject.toml` (`langsmith` was already present as a transitive dep)
- **Edited** `app/config.py` — added `from dotenv import load_dotenv` and `load_dotenv()` at the top so LangSmith env vars are loaded before any LangChain/LangGraph import reads them

## Outcome
LangSmith tracing is enabled. All runs of `graph.invoke()` (via FastAPI or Streamlit) will now be traced to the `pr-aching-restoration-85` project on LangSmith. No models were changed.

## Notes
- `.env` is excluded from git via `.gitignore` — the API key must be re-added manually after cloning.
